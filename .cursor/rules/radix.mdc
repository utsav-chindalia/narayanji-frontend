# Radix UI Best Practices

## Accessibility First
- Rule: Use Radix only for behavior (e.g., dropdown, modal) – you must style it yourself for accessibility.
- Rule: Always pass `asChild` if wrapping with custom components to preserve semantics.

## Composability
- Rule: Treat Radix components like headless UI. Compose them with your design system – don’t override behavior.
- Rule: Use slot-like behavior (`<Component asChild>`) to wrap in custom tags (like `Link` or `button`) cleanly.

## Integration
- Rule: Test keyboard and screen reader behavior in all Radix components.
- Rule: Namespace your overrides or classNames (e.g., `dropdown__trigger`, `tooltip__content`) to avoid style conflicts.

## Customization
- Rule: Never directly style Radix primitives with `styled-components` or CSS – use `className` + Tailwind only.
- Rule: For animation and transitions, prefer `@radix-ui/react-*` transition hooks where available or wrap with `framer-motion`.
